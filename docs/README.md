# sentdebot rev 2

Code for Sentdebot in the [Sentdex nextcord channel](nextcord.gg/sentdex)

Original can be found here [Sentdex / sentdebot](https://github.com/Sentdex/sentdebot)

Community upgrade to the sentdebot codebase. The general idea is to improve the codebase, decouple the code a little and overall make it more flexible so we can add more features.



### Core ideas:
___
* To improve the quality of the codebase, making it more readable
* Decouple the codebase from the bot itself, making it more maintainable
* To make the codebase more flexible, allowing for easy addition of new features

### Core ethos:
___
* No code is precious, if it can be improved, cleaned or otherwise made more usable and friendly, then feel free to do so
* Try to create and maintain a standardized codebase, so that everyone can use it, tinker with it, and improve it
* improve the experience for the end user, by providing discrete but useful features
* Provide quality of life features for new devs, helpers and seniors alike
