# sentdebot

Code for Sentdebot in the Sentdex discord channel (discord.gg/sentdex)

Pull requests welcome for just about anything. 

The "style" of using methods to interact with sentdebot should be retained. 

sentdebot.search("text here") vs !search text here. 

I understand this goes against the main method of making discord bots and commands, but I like interacting my way better :)

Code is messy, or as our resident coding expert sysadmin full stack dev Scoot puts it: "Ugly."

Everything you see on init commit was written in 1 pass to just make it work. Feel free to clean up as you wish.
