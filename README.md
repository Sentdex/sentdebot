Pull requests welcome for just about anything.
The "style" of using methods to interact with sentdebot should be retained.
`sentdebot.search("text here")` vs `!search text here`
I understand this goes against the main method of making discord bots and commands, but I like interacting my way better :)

Everything you see on init commit was written in 1 pass to just make it work. Feel free to clean up as you wish.
